    title: "Thermal Camera for Heat Sensing",
    info: "Thermal cameras detect more than just heat; they detect tiny differences in heat – as small as 0.01°C – and display them as shades of grey or with different colors. Recent technical developments apply thermal infrared image (2D images) onto spatial information (3D images) to obtain 3D temperature distribution model. Three-dimensional space information can be acquired through various 3D scanning methods, such as omnidirectional vision, structured light technology, time-of-flight, and binocular vision technology.",
